Hello World! This project is my first freelance SQL project that analyzes spotify songs, genres, and attributes for a basic data exploratory project. 
Through this I am able to identify what specific data is available, how genres relate to each other, how specific songs are recorded in the database, as well 
as the best means to analyze spotify recoomendations. The project is coded fully in SQL and is one of the larger databases I've worked with. I specifically enjoy 
house music on spotify and used SQL to find some other genres/songs I may like  based on specifed attributes.
